Story Points Rationale
Story points are derived based on effort, complexity and time. I broke down the user story that I wanted to accomplish in Sprint 1 into smaller
manageable tasks. Story points are more critical when working in a team to ensure that team members are making good progress; but I also found that
using story points to self-manage was also helpful to point out when I was lagging behind goals. I tried to build in additional time to account for
unexpected delays, risks, and for the learning curve involved with using software packages that I am less familiar with. I believe I will be able to
complete the project with around 20-ish story points per sprint, using a hybrid approach of “t-shirt” sizing and relative estimation.
